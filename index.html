                    <h1>My Journey</h1>
                    <h3>2020-present</h3>
                    <p>Currently enrolled in the MSCS Align Program at Northeastern University. After completing the first year of the program, which is an accelerated, 
                        intensive adaptation of a undergraduate education in Computer Science, I am in the masters portion of the course. So far I have learned Python, Java,
                        C, Object-Oriented Programming and Discrete Mathematics. Currently, I am learning Web Development using the MERN stack and Software Engineering. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>2015-2019</h3>
                    <p>I graduated with my Masters of Divinity (M.Div.) degree from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. My education required me to learn how
                        to read and translate the Christian Bible from it's original languages of Greek and Hebrew (sorry no Aramaic). I learned about the good
                        and bad history of Christianity, and to appreciate the depth (and breadth) of the Christian tradition. I also was trained in how to work
                        well with people. Here I learned the arts of listening, teamwork and walking with people through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2012-2018</h3>
                    <p>I worked as a Youth Pastor/Director at St. John's Korean United Methodist Church in Lexington, MA for a group of about 30-35
                        amazing young people (ages 11-18). Here I learned how to communicate, giving weekly messages, preparing lessons,
                        offering religious counseling and trying to explain difficult concepts clearly. Here I learned the joy of being kind and patient.
                        I got the chance to work on my emotional intelligence, help struggling communities through service trips and experienced the powerful
                        reward of investing in the next generation. These were the 'good-old-days', at least so far. =)</p>
                    <h3>2008-2012</h3>
                    <p>I graduated with my bachelors degree in Philosophy with a senior thesis titled "All Form and No Content?: 
                        applications of Kant's second categorical imperative". During this time I learned how to think critically, 
                        analyze and appraise arguments. My particular interests were in ethics and the history of Philosphy, which I viewed,
                     at least in part, as a series of iterations by different philosophers and systems to conceptualize reality.</p>
